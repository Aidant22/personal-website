## Aidantobar.com
This is a passion project of creating my own website that provides employers or anyone that would like to contact me with information about me.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). I used [React](https://react.dev/learn) elements as well as Javascript, HTML, TypeScript, and CSS to create my website. 

As I begin to create more web apps using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) I will add links and previews of the apps.
